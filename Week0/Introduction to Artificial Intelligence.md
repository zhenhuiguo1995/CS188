### Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

##### What is AI?

- oldest ideas: the science of making machines that think **logically**
- further idea: building machines that **think like** people
  - -> building machines that **act like** people
- Modern approach: build systems that act **rationally(or optimal)** 
  - being rational means **maximizing your expected utility** -> the aim of the course

#### AI - Learning from brain:

- memory(data) and simulation(computation) are key to decision making



#### Course architect

- Part 1: Intelligence from computation 
  - fast search/planning
  - constraint satisfaction
  - adversarial and uncertain search
- Part 2: Intelligence from data
  - Bayes's nets
  - decision theory
  - machine learning
- Throughout the course: applications
  - natural language
  - computer vision
  - robotics
  - games



#### Limitations of AI: what can AI do?

- What an AI can do:
  -  play game: tennis game, jeopardy
  - drive under some conditions (e.g. a curving mountain road)
  - buy a week's groceries on the web
- What an AI possibly cannot do:
  - discover a new math theorem
  - perform surgery
  - real-translate
  - write an intentionally  funny story



Self-diagnostic:

Marginal probability:  Given two variables X, Y, a distribution P(X, Y) is associated with the two variables, we can obtain a probability distribution as:
$$
P(x) = {\sum _{y}P(x,y)=\sum _{y}{P(X|Y)P(Y)}}
$$
